# 🧠 Rock Paper Scissors – Machine Learning Project

This project is part of my early Machine Learning learning journey during my B.Tech (CSE).

I built this project while learning from the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning course.  
The goal was to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors bot that can win at least 60% of matches against different AI bots.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Create a Python program that:

- Plays Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Learns opponent patterns
- Adapts strategy dynamically
- Wins ≥ 60% against 4 different bots

---

## 🧠 ML Concept Used

This project uses basic Machine Learning concepts:

- Pattern recognition
- Frequency-based prediction
- Simple Markov-style sequence learning
- Adaptive strategy

The bot:
1. Stores opponent move history
2. Detects repeating patterns
3. Predicts next move
4. Plays the counter move

This is a simple form of statistical learning.
